Simple RESTful API for managing ships, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your MongoDB URI and JWT secret.

## Running the API
Start the server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
API runs at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Testing
Run all API tests with:
```sh
npm run test:api
```

## Good Practices
- Input validation and error handling are built-in.
- JWT authentication for protected routes.
- Use environment variables for secrets and config.

---
Keep code modular and responses consistent for maintainability.

### Health
  - Response: `200 OK` `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-09-17T12:00:00.000Z" }`
    - Note: `timestamp` is the current server time in ISO8601 format.

## Authentication Flow
1. Register a user via `/auth/register`.
2. Login via `/auth/login` to receive a JWT token.
3. Use the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header for all protected endpoints.

## Postman Collection

## Example curl Usage
```sh
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"TestPass123!"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"TestPass123!"}'

# Create Ship
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ships \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"name":"Titanic","description":"Famous ship","dateTime":"2025-09-17T12:00:00Z"}'

# Get All Ships
curl http://localhost:3000/ships

# Update Ship
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/ships/<SHIP_ID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"name":"Updated Titanic","description":"Updated description"}'

# Delete Ship
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/ships/<SHIP_ID> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
```

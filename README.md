## Features

-   **Authentication:** Secure endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
-   **Validation:** Built-in validation and clear error handling for all incoming requests.
-   **Configuration:** Environment variable-based setup for easy configuration.
-   **Testing:** Comes with an integrated test suite.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js (v18.x or higher)](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/rajvishwakarma1/fmc.git](https://github.com/rajvishwakarma1/fmc.git)
    cd main
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example and then fill in your details.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    You will need to add your `MONGODB_URI` and a `JWT_SECRET` in the new `.env` file.

### Running the Application

-   **Development Mode:**
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` with hot-reloading.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **Run Tests:**
    Execute the API test suite.
    ```sh
    npm run test:api
    ```

## üîé Quick Testing on Browser

- Test simple GET endpoints (like `/health` or `/ships`) directly in your browser.
- For POST, PUT, DELETE, or authenticated requests, use Postman or curl.
